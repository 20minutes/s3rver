Node Fake S3
==================

This is a NodeJs port of the excellent [FakeS3](https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3) server.

Node FakeS3 is a lightweight server that responds to the same calls Amazon S3 responds to. It is extremely useful for testing of S3 in a sandbox environment without actually making calls to Amazon.

The goal of Fake S3 is to minimise runtime dependencies and be more of a development tool to test S3 calls in your code rather than a production server looking to duplicate S3 functionality.

It is currently under active development.
